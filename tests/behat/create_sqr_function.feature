Feature: create_sqr_function
    In order to use a CodeRunner question in a quiz
    As a teacher
    I need to create a new CodeRunner question

Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
       | username | firstname | lastname | email |
       | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@asd.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
       | fullname | shortname | category |
       | Course 1 | C1 | 0 |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
       | user | course | role |
       | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I follow "Course 1"

Scenario: As a teacher, I create a Python3 sqr(n) -> n**2 function
    When I add a "CodeRunner" question filling the form with:
        | id_coderunnertype | python3 |
        | name           | sqr acceptance question |
        | id_questiontext   | Write a sqr function |
        | id_testcode_0    | print(sqr(-7)) |
        | id_expected_0    | 49 |
    Then I should not see "Save changes"
    And I should not see "Write a sqr function"
    And I should see "sqr acceptance question"
