Feature: sqr_function_runs
    As a teacher I must be able to preview and run a Python3 sqr function

Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
       | username | firstname | lastname | email |
       | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@asd.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
       | fullname | shortname | category |
       | Course 1 | C1 | 0 |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
       | user | course | role |
       | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
    And the following "question categories" exist:
       | contextlevel | reference | questioncategory | name |
       | Course       |    C1     |   Top            | Behat Testing |
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I follow "Question bank"
    And I add a "CodeRunner" question filling the form with:
        | id_coderunnertype | python3 |
        | name              | sqr acceptance question |
        | id_questiontext   | Write a sqr function |
        | id_useace         | |
        | id_testcode_0     | print(sqr(-7)) |
        | id_expected_0     | 49 |  
        | id_testcode_1     | print(sqr(11)) |
        | id_expected_1     | 121 |
        | id_testcode_2     | print(sqr(-3)) |
        | id_expected_2     | 9 |
        | id_display_2      | Hide |


Scenario: As a teacher, I get marked right if I submit a correct answer
    When I click on "a[title='Preview']" "css_element"
    And I switch to "questionpreview" window
    And I set the field "id_behaviour" to "Adaptive mode"
    And I press "Start again with these options"
    And I set the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@name, 'answer')]" to "def sqr(n): return n * n"
    And I press "Check"
    Then the following should exist in the "coderunner-test-results" table:
        | Test           |
        | print(sqr(-3)) |
        | print(sqr(11)) |
    And "print(sqr(11))" row "Expected" column of "coderunner-test-results" table should contain "121"
    And "print(sqr(11))" row "Got" column of "coderunner-test-results" table should contain "121"
    And I should see "Passed all tests!"
    And I should not see "Show differences"
    And I should see "Marks for this submission: 1.00/1.00"

Scenario: As a teacher, I get a syntax error if I submit a syntactically invalid answer to the question preview
    When I click on "a[title='Preview']" "css_element"
    And I switch to "questionpreview" window
    And I set the field "id_behaviour" to "Adaptive mode"
    And I press "Start again with these options"
    And I set the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@name, 'answer')]" to "def sqr(n); return n * n"
    And I press "Check"
    Then I should see "Syntax Error(s)"
    And I should see "Marks for this submission: 0.00/1.00"

Scenario: As a teacher, I get marked wrong if I submit a wrong answer to the question preview
    When I click on "a[title='Preview']" "css_element"
    And I switch to "questionpreview" window
    And I set the field "id_behaviour" to "Adaptive mode"
    And I press "Start again with these options"
    And I set the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@name, 'answer')]" to "def sqr(n): return n * n * n"
    And I press "Check"
    Then the following should exist in the "coderunner-test-results" table:
        | Test           |
        | print(sqr(-3)) |
        | print(sqr(11)) |

    And "print(sqr(11))" row "Expected" column of "coderunner-test-results" table should contain "121"
    And I pause
    And "print(sqr(11))" row "Got" column of "coderunner-test-results" table should contain "1331"
    And I should see "Some hidden test cases failed, too."
    And I should see "Your code must pass all tests to earn any marks. Try again."
    And I should see "Marks for this submission: 0.00/1.00"
